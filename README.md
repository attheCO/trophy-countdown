# CO:de Catalyst Championship Trophy Countdown
Arduino project to countdown seconds to event date.


##Heads-up
The time will restart once powered down. You'll need a battery source (like we did), or install a RTC chip.

#Todos
-   {X} add countdown to event in seconds
-   {X} add add title above countdown
-   { } add countdown success message
-   { } add button and if statement to reset timer (if countdown complete)
-   { } add RTC chip to check today's date/time for a accurate countdown to event date
-   { } add array of fun random messages to popup every 10secs~

#Ideas
-   { } add humidty/tempeture sensor (display surrounding enviroment data) ([example](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-12-lcd-displays-part-2))
-   { } add wifi chip (display outside tempature, update arduino over network: to solve switch to [Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13711) or [Photon board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13321))

Any other suggestions?
